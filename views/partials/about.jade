    p(class='text-justify') My name is Steven Waters and I have been building websites since I was 13 years old (circa 1999). I am currently coding in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES5), Jade, Node.js, Express.js, and Bootstrap 3. I am also starting to utilize various tools and libraries for web development such as Web Pack, Babel, SASS-Lint, ESLint, and JS Standard, and React! In addition, I have a strong background in supporting web applications, developing PHP integrations, designing and developing .NET websites, and coding C#, T-SQL, and writing JavaScript. While building websites and applications, I like to focus on making them user friendly , SEO-friendly, cross-browser compatible, and accessible for people using assistive web technologies.
